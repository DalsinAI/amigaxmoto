/* OpenGPU's SDL2.module (0.6) opens two screens for a SDL_WINDOW_FULLSCREEN
 * window and, when the window goes, leaves two empty ones behind (one of
 * them reopened at its 640x480 desktop mode); they stay in front of the
 * Workbench after the program has ended, grey, until the machine is reset.
 * The module never comes back to them, so after SDL_Quit() the game deals
 * with every screen that was not there before SDL started, has no window
 * left on it and SDL's title: closed if Intuition lets it, else sent behind
 * the Workbench.
